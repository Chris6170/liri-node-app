                                                               # liri-node-app
                                                               
                   This is a node.js application for searching movies, concerts and songs by using API's from:

Spotify , Bands in town and OMDB.

*The list of actions required for each individual search goes as followed:*
* movie-this = search information about movies (#1example: movie-this Blade)
* concert-this = search next available concerts (#2example: concert-this Bad Bunny)
* spotify-this-song = search top 5 songs related to search and include the link to it. (#3example: spotify-this-song Te bote)

*do-what-it-says = input and find out.

                                 *If you run any of these actions without value it will run the default for action used

The majority of the calls will execute if you clone the repo and run liri.js file in the terminal.Except for the Spotify API which requires Client ID and Client secret. You must provide your own Keys in order to get it working properly.
